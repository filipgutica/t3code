# Workbench site

Static product page for the Workbench fork, published at
<https://filipgutica.github.io/t3code/> after Pages is enabled and the workflow
reaches `main`.

From the repository root, with the repository's Node version and dependencies:

```sh
vp run --filter @t3tools/workbench-site dev
vp run --filter @t3tools/workbench-site typecheck
vp run --filter @t3tools/workbench-site build
vp run --filter @t3tools/workbench-site preview
```

Open the printed origin at `/t3code/`. The site imports lossless screenshots from `src/assets/screenshots`; Astro
produces responsive PNG images during the build. Keep the source screenshots free of pairing URLs and private data.

## Publish

In the fork's **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, select **GitHub
Actions** as the source. Merge the site change into `main`. The **Workbench
Pages** workflow checks, builds, and deploys the site; pull requests only build
the artifact. A manual run on `main` can publish the current version again.

Check the deployment URL and the guide, download, and full-size screenshot links
before adding the homepage to the repository's About field or announcement.

If the repository name or host changes, update `site` and `base` in
`astro.config.mjs`. The page derives its canonical URL and local asset URLs from
that configuration. The site has no backend or runtime account connection.
